<p>all of the code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/peterschilling/sloth-draw">good guy github</a>, and the
application is powered by <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">good guy google</a>.</p>

<p>nothing would make me happier than you making sloth drawings with it so
please do that. if you think this is cool maybe we can be friends, let
me know.</p>
