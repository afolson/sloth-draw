# about

this is a thing made of [coffee][0], [snakes][1], the number [5][2], and [me][3] drinking cheap wine and [writing][4] [code][5] for a few nights. [regina][6] is the artist behind the slothbrush and provided very important support of telling me sloth draw was cool.

all of the code is hosted on [good guy github][gh], and the
application is powered by [good guy google][appengine].

nothing would make me happier than you making sloth drawings with it so
please do that. if you think this is cool maybe we can be friends, let
me know.
