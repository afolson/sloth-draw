# about

this is a thing made of [coffee][0], [snakes][1], the number [5][2], and [me][3] drinking cheap wine and [writing][4] [code][5] for a few nights. [regina][6] is the artist behind the slothbrush and provided very important support of telling me sloth draw was cool.

all of the code is hosted on [good guy github][gh], and the
application is powered by [good guy google][appengine].

nothing would make me happier than you making sloth drawings with it so
please do that. if you think this is cool maybe we can be friends, let
me know.

oh! and *mad propz* to [tuxpaint][tp], it's the program that all drawing
programs aspire to be

Some of the co-prosperity applications are so awesome I don't understand how they haven't been funded for years
